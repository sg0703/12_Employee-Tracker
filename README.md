## Installation

Download the project files or clone this repo, then run npm install and it will install dependencies. I included a seed.sql file to create your new database and populate it with some test items I used during development.

## Usage

Type node app and follow the prompts! The app will ask you if you want to manage an Employee, Department, or Role. Each menu has sub-items that will gather input and assist you with managing your employees.
